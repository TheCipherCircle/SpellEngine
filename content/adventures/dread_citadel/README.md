# Dread Citadel Campaign Files

## Canonical Files (DO NOT DELETE)

| File | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| `campaign_source.yaml` | **SOURCE** - Your authored content. Edit THIS file. |
| `campaign.yaml` | **FINAL** - Generated by campaign builder. Game reads THIS. |
| `manifest.yaml` | Campaign metadata (title, description, etc.) |

## Build Artifacts (Safe to Delete)

| File | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| `campaign_source_built.yaml` | Intermediate build artifact |
| `campaign_built.yaml` | Old build artifact |
| `campaign_v2.yaml` | Old version backup |
| `campaign.json` | Old format, not used |

## Workflow

1. Edit `campaign_source.yaml` (your authored content)
2. Run: `python3 -m spellengine.tools.campaign_builder --source campaign_source.yaml`
3. This generates `campaign.yaml` (with passwords from keyspace)
4. Game loads `campaign.yaml`

## Important Notes

- Passwords are **regenerated each build** from keyspace definitions
- Always regenerate the cheat sheet after rebuilding
- The game ONLY reads `campaign.yaml` - other files are ignored
