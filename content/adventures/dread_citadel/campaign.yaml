estimated_time: 45 minutes
intro_text: 'The Dread Citadel looms before you, its obsidian towers piercing the
  blood-red sky.


  For centuries, the Citadel Lord has hoarded the secrets of authentication—

  hash algorithms, password patterns, the very keys to digital kingdoms.


  You have been chosen to join the Cipher Circle—an ancient order of

  pattern breakers who see through the illusions of "secure" passwords.


  But first, you must awaken your gift.


  The Null Cipher awaits to guide you...

  '
outro_text: 'The Citadel Lord falls, his fortress breached, his secrets laid bare.


  You have proven yourself a true Infiltrator of the Cipher Circle.

  The knowledge you gained here—the patterns, the techniques, the instincts—

  will serve you well in battles yet to come.


  But remember: with great power comes great responsibility.

  Use your skills to defend, to educate, to illuminate.


  The Circle remembers those who walk the righteous path.


  Until we meet again, Infiltrator.
