intro_text: |
  The Dread Citadel looms before you, its obsidian towers piercing the blood-red sky.

  For centuries, the Citadel Lord has hoarded the secrets of authentication—
  hash algorithms, password patterns, the very keys to digital kingdoms.

  You have been chosen to join the Cipher Circle—an ancient order of
  pattern breakers who see through the illusions of "secure" passwords.

  But first, you must awaken your gift.

  The Null Cipher awaits to guide you...

outro_text: |
  The Citadel Lord falls, his fortress breached, his secrets laid bare.

  You have proven yourself a true Infiltrator of the Cipher Circle.
  The knowledge you gained here—the patterns, the techniques, the instincts—
  will serve you well in battles yet to come.

  But remember: with great power comes great responsibility.
  Use your skills to defend, to educate, to illuminate.

  The Circle remembers those who walk the righteous path.

  Until we meet again, Infiltrator.

      A spectral figure materializes before you—the Null Cipher, ancient
      guide to all who seek to join the Cipher Circle.

      "Welcome, Initiate. Before you storm the Citadel, you must
      understand the truth that makes us powerful:"

      "Humans are predictable. Their passwords reveal their nature."

      "Let me show you..."
    outro_text: |
      The Null Cipher nods approvingly.

      "You have awakened, Initiate. You see what others cannot—
      the patterns that humans weave into their passwords."

      "Now you are ready to face the Dread Citadel itself."
