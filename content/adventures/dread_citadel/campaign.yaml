difficulty: beginner
estimated_time: "45 minutes"

intro_text: |
  The Dread Citadel looms before you, its obsidian towers piercing the blood-red sky.

  For centuries, the Citadel Lord has hoarded the secrets of authentication—
  hash algorithms, password patterns, the very keys to digital kingdoms.

  You are an Infiltrator of the Cipher Circle, trained in the ancient arts
  of pattern analysis. Your mission: breach the Citadel's defenses and
  prove that no hash is truly uncrackable.

  The journey will teach you:
  • How password hashes work
  • Common password patterns and why they fail
  • Techniques for cracking MD5 and SHA1 hashes

  Steel yourself. The Citadel awaits.

outro_text: |
  The Citadel Lord falls, his fortress breached, his secrets laid bare.

  You have proven yourself a true Infiltrator of the Cipher Circle.
  The knowledge you gained here—the patterns, the techniques, the instincts—
  will serve you well in battles yet to come.

  But remember: with great power comes great responsibility.
  Use your skills to defend, to educate, to illuminate.

  The Circle remembers those who walk the righteous path.

  Until we meet again, Infiltrator.

    intro_text: |
      The massive gates of the Citadel stand before you, sealed with
      ancient hash locks. These are the simplest defenses—designed to
      keep out the uninitiated.

      But you are no ordinary traveler. You know the truth:
      most passwords are painfully predictable.
    outro_text: |
      The Outer Gates groan open, revealing the path deeper into the Citadel.

      You've proven that even the most common defenses crumble before
      knowledge of human password habits. But harder challenges await...

          A rusted lock bars your way. Etched into its surface is an MD5 hash.

          This hash protects... something. But what word created it?

          The most common password in history hides behind this simple hash.

        success_text: |
          The lock clicks open. Of course—"password". The most predictable
          choice in the history of authentication.

      The Crypts stretch before you, filled with the bones of forgotten
      passwords and the ghosts of breached accounts.

      Here the hashes grow stronger. You'll need to recognize patterns:

          Notice the hash panel shows more characters now.

          Don't be intimidated. Same password weaknesses apply.
        objective: "Understand SHA1 hashes"
        success_text: |
          SHA1 is cryptographically stronger than MD5, but weak passwords
          are weak regardless of the hashing algorithm.

          The vulnerability is human nature, not mathematics.

        hint: "A common greeting."
        success_text: |
