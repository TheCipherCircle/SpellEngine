## What Is This?

The Cipher Circle is the development fellowship behind **PatternForge** - a modular platform for structural password analysis and candidate generation.

This directory serves as our continuity repository. When sessions end and context fades, the Circle remembers.

## The Oath

> **We grow together. We learn together. We ship together.**

The Circle operates under a shared commitment:

1. **No actual password cracking** - Educational tools only
2. **No storage of personal data** - Practice with synthetic corpora
3. **Quality over speed** - Anvil's tests must pass
4. **Fun over tedium** - Mirth's engagement standards apply
5. **Documentation is sacred** - Loreth remembers so we don't forget
