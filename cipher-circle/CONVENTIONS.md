### Rules

1. **Credit all contributors** - If multiple agents worked on a commit, include all of them
2. **Keep Claude line** - The `Claude Opus 4.5` co-author remains for transparency about AI involvement
3. **Domain-appropriate attribution** - Art work credits Fraz, QA work credits Anvil, etc.
4. **Primary agent first** - List the lead agent for that work first
