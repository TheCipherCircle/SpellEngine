| Player enters "joshua" | "Shall we play a game?" | WarGames WOPR |
| Crack time < 1 second | "Speed demon!" achievement | Reward fast thinking |

## Konami Code Implementation

```
↑ ↑ ↓ ↓ ← → ← → B A [Enter]
```

**Effect:** Toggles "Retro Mode"
- CRT scanline filter
- Green phosphor text (#00ff00)
- Beep sound effects
- ASCII art gets extra chunky

## Priority for Implementation

1. **Low-hanging fruit:** Hash-based responses (player input triggers)
2. **Flavor:** Narrative eggs (embed in campaign YAML)
3. **Delight:** Achievement eggs (achievement system needed first)
4. **Polish:** Konami code / visual modes (later)
