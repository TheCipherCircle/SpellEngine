# Elevator Pitch

*30 seconds to explain what we built.*

---

PatternForge analyzes password corpora to discover structural patterns, then generates targeted candidates for cracking tools like Hashcat.

Unlike brute-force approaches, PatternForge learns what real passwords look like—length distributions, character patterns, common structures—and produces candidates that match.

It also includes PTHAdventures, a gamified learning mode where you crack hashes through D&D-style storytelling. The lesson IS the challenge.

Built by the Cipher Circle: 9 humans and AI agents collaborating as a team.

**Key differentiators:**
- Pattern discovery separate from candidate synthesis
- Grammar-aware generation (not just masks)
- Educational game mode built-in
- Human-AI team development model
