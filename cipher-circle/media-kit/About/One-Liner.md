# One-Liner

PatternForge is a modular platform for structural password analysis and candidate generation, built by the Cipher Circle.

## Variations

**Technical:**
PatternForge separates pattern discovery from candidate synthesis through SCARAB analysis and EntropySmith generation.

**Game-focused:**
PatternForge includes PTHAdventures, teaching password cracking through interactive D&D-style storytelling.

**Team-focused:**
PatternForge was built by the Cipher Circle, a 9-member human-AI development team.
