## Thread: What is PatternForge?

**Tweet 1:**
🔐 Introducing PatternForge - a new way to analyze passwords and generate cracking candidates.

Not brute force. Pattern-aware.

Thread 🧵👇

**Tweet 2:**
Most password crackers treat all candidates equally.

PatternForge learns what REAL passwords look like:
- Length distributions
- Character patterns
- Common structures

Then generates candidates that match.

**Tweet 3:**
Three engines working together:

📊 SCARAB - Analyzes your corpus
⚡ EntropySmith - Generates candidates
📜 RuleSmith - Creates hashcat rules

Pattern discovery → Candidate synthesis

**Tweet 4:**
But wait, there's more.

PatternForge includes PTHAdventures - learn password cracking through D&D-style storytelling.

The lesson IS the challenge.

**Tweet 5:**
Built by the Cipher Circle - 9 humans and AI agents working as a team.

Not AI-assisted. AI-collaborative.
