# Cipher Circle Party Mechanics

*Rules for XP, grouping, and collaborative rewards*

---

## Group Bonuses

### Mythic Raid Group (10% Bonus XP)
**Requirement:** ALL party members contribute to the same task

When the entire Cipher Circle unites on a single objective, the combined effort earns a **10% XP bonus** on top of base rewards.

```
Example: 8 members complete a 100 XP task together
Base XP: 100
Mythic Bonus: +10% = +10
Total: 110 XP (distributed among participants)
```

**Triggers:**
- Full party collaborates on a feature
- All hands on deck for a critical bug
- Unanimous design decision with everyone contributing

---

### Heroic Party (5% Bonus XP)
**Requirement:** Two groups of 5 or fewer working in parallel

When the party splits into coordinated strike teams (each 5 or fewer members), both groups earn a **5% XP bonus**.

```
Example:
  Team A (Forge, Anvil, Mirth) completes Task 1 = 75 XP
  Team B (Loreth, Fraz, Prism) completes Task 2 = 50 XP

  Team A Bonus: +5% = +3.75 → 78.75 XP
  Team B Bonus: +5% = +2.50 → 52.50 XP
```

**Triggers:**
- Dragon slaying sessions (parallel agents)
- Coordinated sprint work
- Divide-and-conquer strategies
