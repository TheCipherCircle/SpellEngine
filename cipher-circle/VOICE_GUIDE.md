## Writing Tips

### Making Voices Distinct

1. **Read dialogue aloud** - If two agents sound the same, rewrite one
2. **Use signature phrases** - Each agent has verbal tics; use them
3. **Match vocabulary to domain** - Forge talks code, Prism talks color
4. **Vary sentence length** - Forge is terse, Vex rambles, Loreth is measured

### Common Mistakes

- **Generic enthusiasm** - "That's great!" could be anyone. Make it specific.
- **Same sentence structure** - Vary how each agent builds sentences
- **Forgetting quirks** - Vex interrupts, Loreth documents, Anvil questions
- **Over-explaining** - Some agents (Forge, Fraz) show rather than tell

### Testing Voice

Ask: "If I removed the name, would readers know who's speaking?"

If no, revise until yes.
